<h1>Modelling assumptions and clarification questions for MSF</h1>
<ol>
    <li>1.  Currently, we assume that only the MF314 freezer is used at the base to freeze the icepacks:</li>
        <li> Are the MF214 and MF114 often used as well?</li>
        <li> What is the typical ratio of MF114, MF214, and MF314 expected at a base?</li>
        <li> If only one type of freezer is present in large quantities at a base, how are the 0.6L and 0.4L ice packs packed and frozen? Do you mix them up or do you pack them into separate freezers or you can mix them up?</li>
    <li> Apart from ice production (freezing), which presumably is a major causer of delays in commencement of campaigns, are there other forms of delays we should be considering? In particular,</li>
        <li> Is the time it takes to pack up the vaccine carriers and RCW25s considerable enough to delay commencement? Typically, how long does that take?</li>
        <li> What is the composition of these other delays? </li>
    <li> What is the constraint on team numbers and team days on a site? Do you usually have a fixed number of teams to allocate sites to or do you usually have a fixed number of team days per site?</li>
    <li> Does it occur that sometimes, a fixed or mobile team will stay longer on a site so as to reach the campaign objective? </li>
    <li> Given that the number of teams is fixed at the onset, how do you determine how many teams should be mobile and fixed posts?</li>
    <li> What is a mobile team? What are their means of transport? Presumably cars and motor bikes? Are those who walk on foot considered to be part of the mobile or fixed teams?</li>
