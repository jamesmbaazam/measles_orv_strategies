#Project Requirements: The 5WH
1. Why am I pursuing this project?
	A. The goal of this project is to evaluate various vaccinations 
	strategies for responding to measles outbreaks in low-income settings.
	B. The vaccination strategies revolve around the decision to use: 
		i. 10-dose vaccine in the cold chain,
		ii. Monodose (1-dose) vaccine in the cold chain,
		iii. Monodose outside of cold chain. 
	C. The major motivation of this project stems from the potential use of the measles monodose 
	vaccine outside of the campaign to surmount the delays usually encountered from ensuring that vaccines 
	are kept cold. 
	D. The purpose of this repository and code is to create scripts for running
	the ordinary differential equations and difference equations for simulating the
	model and its output including figures.
2. What:
	A. separate scripts for the epidemiological model, logistical model, and the combined analysis
	B. The code should be reproducible
	C. Pseudo-randomness/stochasticity that captures the uncertainties in the project.
3. When did this project begin, how long is it supposed to run for, when is it due?
	A. This project began in 2018 and a dissertation is supposed to be submitted by the
	end of October 2020.
	B. Ideally, simulations should not take more than half a day to run.
4. Where will the project reside?
	A. The initial code will be solely written in R for consistency. No other language will be used.
	B. A clone of this project code should run on all platforms: Windows, Ubuntu/Linux, OSX
5. Who is involved with the creation and use of this project?:
	A. I, and my supervisors ensure that the project is sound and the techniques are appropriate
	B. The results of this work are to be provided to the scientific community
	C. Any other R user should be able to read and understand my code
6. How is this project going to be implemented?
	A. I envisage R scripts that run groups of functions for achieving a major goal for 
	example, all visualisation code should go into one script.
	B. I envisage having one analysis script that sources all the other scripts to allow me to access
	and use the functions I've created.
