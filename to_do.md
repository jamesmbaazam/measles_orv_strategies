# To do
1. Make a design diagram (workflow) for the model and simulation structure
2. Make scenario definitions a dataframe instead of a list of data frames
3. Create a data frame of scenarios for running epidemiological scenarios
4. Create a separate script for running and saving supply chain analyses per strategy and scenario (equipment type and team dispatch rules)
5. Create a separate script that loads the supply chain output as input for running the transmission dynamics scenarios
6. Create separate scripts for each figure. Each script should load and transform the relevant model outputs
7.
