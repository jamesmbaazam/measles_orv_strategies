# Shiny app for comparing various vaccination decisions during outbreaks

We intend to use this app as a strategic tool to assess various outbreak response vaccination strategies. The assessment will mostly be done based on the cold chain needs in terms of ice, freezing times, and passive cold chain requirements.

## Modelling assumptions and clarification questions for MSF

    1.  Currently, we assume that only the *MF314* freezer is used at the base to freeze the icepacks:
        a. Are the MF214 and MF114 often used as well?
        b. What is the typical ratio of MF114, MF214, and MF314 expected at a base?
        c. If only one type of freezer is present in large quantities at a base, how are the 0.6L and 0.4L ice packs packed and frozen? Do you mix them up or do you pack them into separate freezers?
    2. Apart from ice production (freezing), which presumably is a major causer of delays in commencement of campaigns, are there other forms of delays we should be considering? In particular,
        a. Is the time it takes to pack up the vaccine carriers and RCW25s considerable enough to delay commencement? Typically, how long does that take?
        b. What is the composition of these other delays?
    3. What is the constraint on team numbers and team days on a site? Do you usually have a fixed number of teams to allocate sites to or do you usually have a fixed number of days per site?
    4. Does it occur that sometimes, a fixed or mobile team will stay longer on a site so as to reach the campaign objective?
        - _What are you trying to get at with this question? See if you can frame it so that you'll get the information you need, instead of as a yes/no question._
    5. Once you know how many teams are going to a site, how do you determine how many teams should be mobile and fixed posts?
    6. What is a mobile team? What are their means of transport? Presumably cars and motor bikes? Are those who walk on foot considered to be part of the mobile or fixed teams?
        - under what circumstances do mobile teams vaccinate "near" kids?
